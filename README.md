# To-Do-App

Hi everyone! :)

In this repository, i created a really simple To-Do App:

You can create a single task, or clear the page.

I just created two logos: one for the title and the other for the footer.
I used two functions (linked to two buttons):
one that lets you create a new "li" element (in this case, it's a new task), 
and the other one clear the entire "UL" element, clearing the list.

This is the v1.0. 
I'm gonna update it later, adding an option to remove a single task,
and maybe some animations.
